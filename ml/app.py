Think of glial cells as the helpers or caretakers for the brains nerve cells (neurons) <br> How do they develop - Gliomas can develop when the cells start to grow uncontrollably. This can happen for various reasons, including genetic factors or exposure to certain environmental factors, although the exact cause is often unclear <br> The symptoms of gliomas can vary depending on their size and location in the brain. Common signs include:Headaches, Seizure, Nausea or vomiting, changes in vision, memory problem <br> Treatment options - Surgery: To remove as much of the tumor as possible; Radiation Therapy: Using high-energy rays to kill cancer cells; Chemotherapy: Using medications to target and kill cancer cells.''',

These tumors are generally slow-growing and can vary in size. Most meningiomas are benign, which means they are not cancerous. However, some can be atypical or malignant (cancerous). <br> Symptoms - Headaches, Seizures, Vision Problems, Hearing Loss, Weakness or Numbness, Changes in Personality or Memory <br> Treatment Options - 1. Watchful Waiting: If the tumor is small and not causing problems, doctors may just monitor it over time with regular imaging. <br>2. Surgery: If the tumor is causing symptoms or growing, it may be surgically removed. This is often the first choice of treatment. <br>3. Radiation Therapy: Sometimes used after surgery to kill any remaining tumor cells or for tumors that canâ€™t be safely removed.<br>4.
